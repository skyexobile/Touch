# Touch

OutputTest.py is current code for Touch Media project. Requires devices plugged in.

Other programs will need to ping test_server with its data.

Test_server contains clock and will record timestamp of other programs. It will then send data to test_cient (metadata stream), which writes data out in a csv.
